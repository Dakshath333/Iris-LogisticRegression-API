# Iris-LogisticRegression-API
A simple Flask REST API for predicting iris flower species using a logistic regression model trained on the Iris dataset.

# Iris Logistic Regression API 🌸

This project demonstrates how to train a machine learning model using logistic regression on the classic Iris dataset and serve predictions via a Flask-based REST API.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- Trains a logistic regression model with standardized features
- Saves the model as `model.pkl` using `pickle`
- Provides a REST API (`/predict`) to classify new iris samples based on input features
